# TP - Acquisition and Radiometry (Master ATSI)

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook created on Google Colab as part of the practical work on acquisition and radiometry in the Master ATSI program.

## Description

The goal of this project is to explore various aspects of digital image analysis and processing. The key points covered include:

- **Grayscale Analysis**: study of pixel intensities in images.
- **Generation and Analysis of Histograms**: extraction and visualization of statistics.
- **Effects of Gaussian Noise**: simulation and evaluation of its impact on textures, contrast, and brightness of images.

The notebook also provides Python code to process and visualize relevant results.

## Main Features

- Loading and preprocessing images.
- Generation of Gaussian noise and comparison of images before and after disturbance.
- Calculation and display of histograms to analyze the distribution of grayscale levels.
- Statistical analysis of images.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following:

- **Google Colab** (or any environment compatible with Jupyter notebooks).
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scipy`
  - `Pillow`

## Installation and Execution

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <REPOSITORY-URL>

2. Open the file `TP Acquisition et Radiom√©trie.ipynb` on Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

3. Install the necessary dependencies if they are not already available in your environment:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib scipy pillow


4. Run the cells one by one to see the results.

## Project structure

- **Notebook principal** :
  - `TP Acquisition Radiometry.ipynb` : contains all the code and explanations.

## Expected Results

The notebook generates:

- Visualizations of histograms before and after adding noise.
- A comparative analysis of images with and without noise.
- Detailed statistics on grayscale levels.
